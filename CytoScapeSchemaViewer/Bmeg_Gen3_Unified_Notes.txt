Breaking Changes / Steps taken to Unify BMEG-FHIR graph schema

0. Generate iceberg graph schema from iceberg-schema-tools main branch. Add develop branch bmeg-etl
schemas to the iceberg graph schemas that were just generated.

1. Remove Command, File, add Linkage DocumentReference -> Aliquot. in DocumentReference.yaml
    Note: Since Task doesn't have a formal connection to DocumentReference and Specimen in
    FHIR proper, these links don't show up when viewing as the graph schema.
    Because of this, Command (Task) -> File (DocumentReference) -> Aliquot
    linkage can be substituted for just DocumentReference -> Aliquot for now.
2. In aliquot.yaml: remove - property/link: sample and add link to Specimen.yaml
3. In Sample.yaml: remove property/link: phenotypes and add it to Specimen.yaml
4. In Sample.yaml remove property/link: case, and do not add anything as Specimen.yaml link to Patient.yaml already exists.
5. In Sample.yaml remove property/link: project, and add it to Specimen.yaml as rel/ResearchStudies. Remove this file entirely from the graph.
6. In aliquot.yaml remove property/link: projects and replace it with ResearchStudies rel/project
7. In case.yaml remove property/link to project:
    In BMEG case -> project exists, but in FHIR patient has no outbound edges to anything, so by convention,
    This should probably be preserved and it should be ResearchStudy -> Patient, which already exists, but not sure about this.
8. In compound.yaml, remove property/link project and in Substance.yaml add the link to ResearchStudy.yaml
9. In Case.yaml remove the link to phenotype.yaml and in Patient.yaml add a property/link to phenotype.yaml.
        Similar to #7, case -> phenotype is expressed in BMEG schema but, FHIR doesn't like outbound edges from Patient.
            Here though, I think it makes more sense to say a Patient has a phenotype then to say a Phenotype has a patient.
            So going to stick with the original BMEG edge directionality.
10. In Patient.yaml add a link/property to Substance.yaml. Remove the link from case to compound, and remove case from the graph entirely.
11. in gene_phenotype_association.yaml remove link/property to compound.yaml and add a link/property to Substance.yaml
12. in protein_compound_association.yaml replace all instances of compound with substance.
13. in drug_response.yaml replace all instances of compound with substance

Replaced Vertices:
    Sample.yaml -> Specimen.yaml,
    program.yaml/project.yaml -> ResearchStudy.yaml,
    case.yaml -> Patient.yaml,
    compound.yaml -> Substance.yaml

Normalization Differences:

There needs to be a decision made on the convention of naming rel fields in links.
FHIR uses rel: {field_name/target_vertex} while BMEG just uses {field_name}
Same thing is going on with links.backref field. Also, in FHIR backref is key:value
while in BMEG it is a list entry. This needs to be normalized. In BMEG, description fields are enclosed
with single quotes while this does not exist in FHIR schema. Also, property fields in BMEG schemas don't really
match the FHIR property schemas. FHIR ones tend to have the fields $ref,description,title,element_property,with enum_reference_tyes
used to show which nodes the property could map to, while bmeg properties are more minimal. This should probably be normalized.
The first entry in the linkage lists is rel in BMEG schemas but it is href in FHIR schemas.
This should get normalized to either all rel or all href.

Design Opinions:

I think that the Substance/Compound and Phenotype linkages to Patient might be better
connected to researchSubject instead, since they coming from Research/BMEG vertices.

Instead of merging Compound Substance it might be better to merge links from Substance to Compound.

Task connections should be added to DocumentReference and Specimen in the graph schema
since FHIR is getting broken already by merging FHIR schema with BMEG schema.
